		<h2>A Day in the Life of Emily Lloyd - In the Summer</h2>
		<p>
			"My name is Emily Lloyd, and this summer, I did a magnitude of things. Typically, I worked at Cracker Barrel during the day, where I greeted and walked people to their seat. When I was not at work, I took photos for my freelance business, and I read many many books. This summer was a typical boring summer with no vacations, but I felt fulfilled by the end of it and ready to start the new school year, my senior year of college. "

		</li>
		<p>
			"I love photography! I have been big into it since the age of twelve. I enjoy taking photos during the summer and making some extra money to use as spending money, and so I typically like to stay busy with photo sessions during this time. You can check out my photos at: <a href="https://www.emilylloydphotos.com/">emilylloydphotos.com</a>

			"Reading"
		</li>
		<p>
			"This summer, I have also read lots of books. Colleen Hoover is easily one of my favorite authors currently, and I have read five of her books so far over the span of the summer. I am going to read It Ends With Us next, and then, Reminders of Him. I have always loved reading, and find that it brings a sense of peace to my mind when I am stressed. I plan on using reading this school semester to de-stress a lot."

			"My Job"
		</li>
		<p>
			"Lastly, this summer I worked at Cracker Barrel as a host for a large part of my summer. This job, I greeted and sat customers throughout the day, and organized menus. I found myself at Cracker Barrel mostly in the evenings, but I worked Friday mornings and Saturday mornings which were always super hectic! If you've never eaten at Cracker Barrel, I highly recommend. Their food is so delicious, and they have a large selection of options!
